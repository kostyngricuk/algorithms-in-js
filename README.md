# Algorithms in JavaScript
## What is an algorithm ?
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems or conduct a computation in mathematics and computer science.

*Before using algorithms you should know about data structures like: arrays, linked lists, trees, queues, stacks, graphs, hash tables, etc.*


## Search algorithms
Search algorithms are designed to efficiently retrieve information stored within data structures.
When data growing we have to do everything to improve the speed of working our programs.
The **Search algorithms** uses to quickly find something in the data structure.

### List of SEARCH algorithms:
1. [Linear Search](/search/linear-search/) - Sequentially checks each element until the desired value is found or the list ends.
2. [Binary Search](/search/binary-search/) - Finding the position of a target value within a **sorted array**. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.


## Sorting algorithms
They arrange data in a particular order, typically numerical or lexicographical, which is important for optimizing other algorithms that require sorted data to function correctly.

### List of SORT algorithms:
- [Quick Sort](/sort/quick-sort/) - Utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach to partition arrays and sort the elements efficiently.
- [Bubble Sort](/sort/bubble-sort) - Through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed.
- [Selection Sort](/sort/selection-sort) - Compare minimum with the second element. If the second element is smaller than minimum, assign the second element as minimum.
- [Merge Sort](/sort/merge-sort) - Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
